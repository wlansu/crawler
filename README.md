# Crawler
Example webcrawler for code assessment.

# What it does
The crawler fetches all urls from "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" and parses them to find the 
most frequently used words. These are then printed to the terminal.

# Caveats
- There is a time limit of 60 seconds. Therefore not all links from the page are scraped.
- All errors are ignored.
